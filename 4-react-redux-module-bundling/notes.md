# React + Redux + Module Bundling

## Issues to tackle

When websites grow bigger and bigger...

* Maintainability
* Readability
* Bug detection

**SOLUTION**: Framework and library

## State of Front-end Development

Tools of choice:

* Angular
* React
* Vue

Senior developer's perpective: These libraries are just tools, so each one of them is perfect for its own specific use case. *So care less about one specific tool, but more about which tool is good for the job at hand.*

### Thought process on choosing the tool

* Angular
  * Working for a large bank with massive codebase
  * Because Angular is a framework, which means it's an *entire kitchen*
  * Making sure everyone's working in the same kitchen and sticks to the rules
* React
  * Working in a company with strong developer team who also needs to be flexible in adding different tools
  * React is more like an *oven*, good for specific tasks, but most likely we will need to add other tools
* Vue
  * Working for a company that hires a lot of junior developers
  * It offers a simple way of writing code that is easy to get started and understand
  * Vue is like an microwave, super simple and easy to pick up

Reasons of picking React for this course

* It teaches you really good javascript principles that will last you a lifetime beyond just the library
* It has the strongest job demand
